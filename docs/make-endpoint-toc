# This is a super basic and super dumb awk script that can be used to make a
# GitHub compatible Table-of-Contents in Markdown based on API information
# given in a specific format.  The markdown file must be passed over stdin or
# as the first argument.  Example:
#
# $ ./make-endpoint-toc index.md
# | name | endpoint |
# ...
#
# This script requires:
#
# 1. all endpoint documentation must be contained in an h1 header named
# "Endpoints"
# 2. endpoint names begin with an h2 (##) header
# 3. endpoint paths contain their own code block (4 spaces at the beginning of
# their line)
#
# This script will output a markdown table with links to the h2 (endpoint
# names) anchors.
